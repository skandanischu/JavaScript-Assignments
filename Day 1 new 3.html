    <p>there are 6 data types in JS they are:<br> 1.Number
        <br> 2.BigInt <br> 3.String <br> 4.Boolean <br> 5.Null <br> 6.undefined <br></p>
    <p> 1. Number: The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.<br> There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.<br></p>
    <p>2.BigInt: BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.<br> A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer<br></p>
    <p>3.Strings: A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes. Double quotes "abc", Single quotes 'abc',& backticks.<br></p>
    <P>4.Boolean: The boolean type has only two values: true and false.<br></P>
    <p>5.Null: The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.<br> It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:<br></p>
    <p> 6.undefined: The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.<br> The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.<br>
